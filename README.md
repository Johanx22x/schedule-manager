# Schedule manager

This is a terminal based program that I use to manage my university notes.

This program is in development, if you want to contribute feel free to do so.

If you are interested into take notes using Latex I recommend you to see this repository [Latex template handler](https://github.com/Johanx22x/latex_template_handler).
